    """Drop suboptimal points and refines the endogenous grid, policy, and value.

    Computes the upper envelope over the overlapping segments of the
    decision-specific value functions, which in fact are value "correspondences"
    in this case, where multiple solutions are detected. The dominated grid
    points are then eliminated from the endogenous wealth grid.
    Discrete choices introduce kinks and non-concave regions in the value
    function that lead to discontinuities in the policy function of the
    continuous (consumption) choice. In particular, the value function has a
    non-concave region where the decision-specific values of the
    alternative discrete choices (e.g. continued work or retirement) cross.
    These are referred to as "primary" kinks.
    As a result, multiple local optima for consumption emerge and the Euler
    equation has multiple solutions.
    Moreover, these "primary" kinks propagate back in time and manifest
    themselves in an accumulation of "secondary" kinks in the choice-specific
    value functions in earlier time periods, which, in turn, also produce an
    increasing number of discontinuities in the consumption functions
    in earlier periods of the life cycle.
    These discontinuities in consumption rules in period t are caused by the
    worker's anticipation of landing exactly at the kink points in the
    subsequent periods t + 1, t + 2, ..., T under the optimal consumption policy.
